DriverPass System Design Project

Designed a comprehensive system for DriverPass, a platform that helps students prepare for their driver’s license exams through online study tools, lesson scheduling, and progress tracking. The project focused on translating client needs into a clear, user-centered software design that supports students, instructors, administrators, and IT staff.

I created detailed UML diagrams (use case, activity, and class diagrams) to map system workflows and user interactions. These visuals helped clarify system structure and served as a strong foundation for future development and stakeholder communication.

Through analysis of the client interview, I identified key user roles and operational requirements, ensuring the system aligned with real-world workflows. This user-focused approach improves usability, reduces errors, and increases adoption.

If revisiting the project, I would enhance the use case diagram with more detailed flows and constraints to better support developers during implementation. Going forward, I plan to apply iterative prototyping and early user feedback to refine designs faster and adapt to evolving requirements.
